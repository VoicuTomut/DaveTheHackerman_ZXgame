# DAVE the Hackerman
(who is actually a dodo)

## Story 
A long time ago, before Penguins and Polar Bears ruled the world, Dodos were one of the most advanced civilizations. Legends say they passed even the NISQ era and created an eternal, coherent qubit at room temperature.
But all this technological advancement was lost together with the life of all the dodos in the cold Ice Age.
 

In the old war between Bears and Penguins, they started to research the advanced technologies of the ancient civilization because they knew that the first who would gain Quantum Advantage would dominate the Ice Berg market. 
 

###1976:
Bears founded an old Dodo temple with two well-preserved dodos exemplars.
 

###1994: 
Penguins launched an attack over the archeological site. They were able to retrieve one of the dodos.
 

###1998:
PenguinSnowLab(PSL) uses dodos DNA to create DAVE, the android dodo. They say that dave is an augmented version of a classical dodo, giving him quantum computing enhancements.
 

###2020:
Dave the Dodo escaped from the PenguinSnowLab. The penguins claim that Dave quickly decrypted all their devices.
 

###2021:
Now, Help Dave hack into the PolarBearhIncorporate (PBI) database to retrieve the DNA sequence of his Dodo friend. 
 

PBI firewall is almost unpenetrable; however, with his quantum computing ability, Dave has a real chance to resurrect his girlfriend, but he needs your help to optimize his circuits using to resist in front of the enemy antivirus wave.
