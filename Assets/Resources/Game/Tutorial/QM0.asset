  info1: "\u201CThe ZX-calculus is a graphical language that goes beyond circuit
    diagrams. It \u2018splits the atom\u2019 of well-known quantum logic gates to
    reveal the compositional structure inside. The calculus works by generalising
    the ideas of Z and X operations, allowing us to break out of the circuit model
    while maintaining soundness of reasoning. In doing so we can show properties
    of circuits, entanglement states, and protocols, in a visually succinct but logically
    complete manner.\u201D\n(https://zxcalculus.com/intro.html)"
  info2: 'The ZX-calculus has two important meta-rules:

    # Only connectivity
    matters

    # Everything is still true if you swap red and green


    In this
    game you have to use some of the ZX-calculus rules to optimize the Graph in order
    to help DAVE hack into the PolarBearIncorporate (PBI) database.
