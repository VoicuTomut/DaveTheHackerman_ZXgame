  info1: 'After you click the "Check out" button in the Circuit Optimization screen,
    the game calculates how optimized your final circuit is.


    If you optimized
    your circuit well, you will not take damaged and a blue explosion will appear
    around your character.


    If your circuit is not well optimized, a red explosion
    will appear around your character and you will take damage.'
  info2: "Both blue and red explosions nullify nearby enemy bullets.\n\nIf you take
    damage, one of your character's corners will disappear. \n\nIf you take damage
    3 times.... Game over....\n\n(the circuits are not difficult to optimize anyway...
    at least for now)"
