  info1: "Spider fusion \n\nIf two green spiders are joined (there is a wire from
    one to the other) then you can merge those two spiders together. As you do so
    the newly merged spider maintains all its other connections. If the spiders had
    angles on them (called phases) then you add those angles together, remembering
    to work modulo 2pi."
