  info1: "Also known as the Hadamard rule, it describes the action of the Hadamard
    gate (the yellow squares.) \nHadamard gates turn a spider into a spider of the
    opposite color. \nChanging the color of a spider adds a Hadamard gate on each
    line connected to the spider."
  info2: 'To change the color of a spider, click on it to select it (the selected
    spider has a blue circle around it) then right-click.


    The color of the
    spider is changed and Hadamard gates (yellow squares) appear around it.'
